# Monkey Shines 2: Gorilla Warfare
This project is intended to both preserve and hopefully one day port Gorilla Warfare to modern systems. For more information on this game as well as a download link to the **original mac release**, please see [Monkey Shines 2: Gorilla Warfare on The Macintosh Garden](https://macintoshgarden.org/games/monkey-shines-2-gorilla-warfare).

## Branch Information
- `master`: development branch, so any work to make this run on a modern system, whether it be inclusion of modern libraries, changes to code style, changes to language, anything of that nature, would be put here.
- `mac_classic`: historical branch. Always contains the original unmodified C sources and headers for the original game.
