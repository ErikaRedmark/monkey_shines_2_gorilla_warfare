# Original Monkey Shines 2: Gorilla Warfare Source Code
This branch contains the original Mac OS Classic "Monkey Shines 2: Gorilla Warfare" source code. This was originally a CodeWarrior project. At the moment, this code isn't connected well in a way where it can easily be buildable even on a Mac. This branch is mainly intended for reference as opposed to building, and to keep a record of the original implementation of Gorilla Warfare.

I am not opposed to adding things that would help it to at least build, like CodeWarrior project files and the like, so that one could clone the source and copy it to a Mac and build it there (although I am not aware of any Git clients that run on Mac OS Classic.)

If you wanted to build this, you would likely need a classic Mac dev environment with CodeWarrior, and include the Macintosh Toolbox libraries.

## Adding to this branch
Please only add to this branch anything related to the *original game*. This is *NOT* a branch for development! I would highly suggest, if you want to make changes to the base game as it builds for Mac, please fork this repository.

Changes that would be okay for this branch would include:
- Source code for related programs (level editor/keygen)
- Infrastructure to help make it easier to immediately compile for Mac OS Classic, such as Codewarrior project files or other documentation.

Bottom line - this branch is intended for history and reference.
