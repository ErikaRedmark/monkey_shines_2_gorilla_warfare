# Original Monkey Shines 2: Gorilla Warfare Source Code
This branch contains the original Mac OS Classic "Monkey Shines 2: Gorilla Warfare" source code. This was originally a CodeWarrior project. At the moment, this code isn't connected well in a way where it can easily be buildable even on a Mac. This branch is mainly intended for reference as opposed to building, and to keep a record of the original implementation of Gorilla Warfare.

I am not opposed to adding things that would help it to at least build, like CodeWarrior project files and the like, so that one could clone the source and copy it to a Mac and build it there (although I am not aware of any Git clients that run on Mac OS Classic.)

If you wanted to build this, you would likely need a classic Mac dev enviroment with CodeWarrior, and include the Macintosh Toolbox libraries.
